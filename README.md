My homage to Person of Interest's Harold Finch:

The code uses Python OpenCV alongside Python SpeechRecognition 3.1.3, to achieve face detection by speech input.

To install SpeechRecognition 3.1.3 on your linux system, type the following commands:

sudo apt-get install python-pyaudio python3-pyaudio

sudo apt-get install python-pip

sudo pip install SpeechRecognition
